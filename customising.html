  <h1>Customising Ontomasticon</h1>
  <p><a href="https://ontomasticon.github.io">Ontomasticon</a> is a simple, lightweight ontology and glossary server written in PHP and making use of MariaDB or MySQL.</p>
  <p>Ontomasticon is simple to customise using a mixture of CSS and PHP templates.</p>
  
  <h2>CSS Theming</h2>
  <p>Ontomasticon comes with minimal theming out of the box. In order to facilitate easy code upgrades the only suggested method
    of customising the CSS is to move the file settings/user.css.default to settings/user.css and make your required changes in this
    file.</p>
  
  <h2>PHP Templates</h2>
  <p>Various PHP templates are found in the templates folder. The supported method of user modification is to copy files you wish to 
    change into the settings directory where edits can be made, and will remian in place during code updates. The overall page layout
    is provided by the core.php file. The homepage is structured by home.php, and controlled vocabulary pages by cv.php.</p>
  
  <p>Fragment templates may be used multiple times on a page, and/or on multiple pages. The term-fragment.php file is used to control
    how individual terms are displayed.</p>
