  <h1>Customising Ontomasticon</h1>
  <p>Ontomasticon is a simple, lightweight ontology and glossary server written in PHP and making use of MariaDB or MySQL.</p>
  <p>Ontomasticon is simple to customise using a mixture of CSS and PHP templates.</p>
  
  <h2>CSS Theming</h2>
  <p>Ontomasticon comes with minimal theming out of the box. In order to facilitate easy code upgrades the only suggested method
    of customising the CSS is to move the file settings/user.css.default to settings/user.css and make your required changes in this
    file.</p>
